# Laravel MySQL Partition

**Laravel-mysql-partition** is a useful Laravel package to easily work with [MySQL Partition](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning.html). please check the documentation for your MySQL version. Partitioning require a MySQL's version >= 5.1.0

  <img src="shell.gif" width="100%" alt="InAppNotify" title="InAppNotify">
</p>

Add the package using composer:

```sh
composer vkoori/laravel-mysql-partition
```

For Laravel versions before 5.5 or if not using auto-discovery, register the service provider in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
  /*
   * Package Service Providers...
   */
  Brokenice\LaravelMysqlPartition\PartitionServiceProvider::class,
],
```

## Quickstart

### Create a migration

From the command line:

```shell
php artisan make:migration create_partitioned_table
```

Then edit the migration you just created by adding one of the partition schema provided by this package;

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Brokenice\LaravelMysqlPartition\Models\Partition;
use Brokenice\LaravelMysqlPartition\Schema\Schema;

class CreatePartitionedTable extends Migration {

    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('partitioned', static function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->bigInteger('id');
            $table->string('name');
            $table->date('date');
            $table->timestamps();
            $table->primary(['id','date']);
        });

        // Force autoincrement of one field in composite primary key
        Schema::forceAutoIncrement('partitioned', 'id');

        // Make partition by LIST
        Schema::partitionByList('partitioned', 'id',
            [
                new Partition('server_east', Partition::LIST_TYPE, [1,43,65,12,56,73]),
                new Partition('server_west', Partition::LIST_TYPE, [534,6422,196,956,22])
            ]
        );
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::drop('partitioned');
    }
}
```

Run the migration:

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

## Partitions support

Package supports these methods of partitions:

**Mysql Partition Types Supports:**

-   RANGE
-   LIST
-   HASH
-   KEY

**Special Partition Types Supports:**

-   YEARS
-   YEARS AND MONTH
-   MONTH (cooming soon)
-   DAYS (cooming soon)

### Partition by RANGE

This type of partitioning assigns rows to partitions based on column values falling within a given range.

```
Schema::partitionByRange('partitioned', 'YEAR(date)', [
    new Partition('anno2000', Partition::RANGE_TYPE, 2000),
    new Partition('anno2001', Partition::RANGE_TYPE, 2001),
    new Partition('anno2002', Partition::RANGE_TYPE, 2002),
    new Partition('anno2003', Partition::RANGE_TYPE, 2003),
]);
```

> **Note**: Using the above code you will not be able to insert records that do not correspond to any range, for example: 2010, to do this you must specify the creation of a partition for future values, you can do so by specifying the parameter ** includeFuturePartition ** to true, as per example:

```
Schema::partitionByRange('partitioned', 'YEAR(date)', [
    new Partition('anno2000', Partition::RANGE_TYPE, 2000),
    new Partition('anno2001', Partition::RANGE_TYPE, 2001),
    new Partition('anno2002', Partition::RANGE_TYPE, 2002),
    new Partition('anno2003', Partition::RANGE_TYPE, 2003),
], true);
```

### Partition by LIST

Similar to partitioning by RANGE, except that the partition is selected based on columns matching one of a set of discrete values.

```
Schema::partitionByList('partitioned', 'id',
    [
        new Partition('server_east', Partition::LIST_TYPE, [1,43,65,12,56,73]),
        new Partition('server_west', Partition::LIST_TYPE, [534,6422,196,956,22])
    ]
);
```

### Partition by HASH

With this type of partitioning, a partition is selected based on the value returned by a user-defined expression that operates on column values in rows to be inserted into the table. The function may consist of any expression valid in MySQL that yields a nonnegative integer value. An extension to this type, LINEAR HASH, is also available.

```
Schema::partitionByHash('partitioned', 'YEAR(date)', 10);
```

### Partition by KEY

This type of partitioning is similar to partitioning by HASH, except that only one or more columns to be evaluated are supplied, and the MySQL server provides its own hashing function. These columns can contain other than integer values, since the hashing function supplied by MySQL guarantees an integer result regardless of the column data type.

```
Schema::partitionByKey('partitioned', 10);
```

### Partition by YEARS

This type of partitioning allow you to partition a table for a specified years range.

```
Schema::partitionByYears('partitioned', 'date', 2000, 2010);
```

You can omit the end year of range, and current year will be used:

```
Schema::partitionByYears('partitioned', 'date', 2000);
```

### Partition by YEARS AND MONTHS

This type of partitioning allow you to partition a table for a specified years range, and sub partition each year for a month.

```
Schema::partitionByYearsAndMonths('test_part', 'date', 2019);
```

You can omit the end year of range, and current year will be used:

## Composite primary key

To partition a table, columns must be an index, if you want to use a different column from **id** you have to change this line of you migration file:

```
$table->bigIncrements('id');
```

to this, creating a composite primary key

```
$table->bigInteger('id');
$table->primary(['id','date']);
```

> **Note**: Using the above code you'll lose the autoincrement for id field, you can force it before run partition, if you need, with this code:

```
Schema::forceAutoIncrement('partitioned', 'id');
```

## Querying parition with Eloquent

Using this package you can query an individual partition, or multiple partitions, directly from eloquent model:

### Create a model

```shell
php artisan make:model Partitioned
```

Then edit the model you just created:

```php
namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Partitioned extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'partitioned';
}
```

### Query to a single partition

```php
Psy Shell v0.9.9 (PHP 7.3.6 — cli) by Justin Hileman
>>> use App\Models\Partitioned;
>>> Partitioned::partition('name')->first();
```

### Query to a multiple partition

```php
Psy Shell v0.9.9 (PHP 7.3.6 — cli) by Justin Hileman
>>> use App\Models\Partitioned;
>>> Partitioned::partitions(['name', 'name1'])->first();
```

## Artisan command

This package comes with a useful set of artisan command:

```php
php artisan laravel-mysql-partition
            {action : Action to perform}
            {--table=} {--method=} {--number=} {--excludeFuture} {--column=} {--partitions=*}
```

### Available commands

# or
$ composer test:unit
```

### Comming soon

```shell
$ composer test:integration
```

Integration tests will require a running MySQL database. If you have Docker installed, you can start easily start one:

```shell
$ make start_db     # starts MySQL 8.0
# or
$ make start_db V=5.7   # starts MySQL 5.7
```
